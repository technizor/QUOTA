{"name":"Quota","tagline":"A number game about your futile attempts to meet the absurd quotas of everyday life.","body":"# Rules:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe game uses a 5x5 board, with 5 row and 5 column sums (QUOTAs) which are randomly generated.\r\nPlayers take turns placing numbers from 1-3 onto the board.\r\n\r\nIf the total of the entries of a row/column are greater than or equal to the QUOTA, then that row/column is considered 'finished'. No moves can be made in finished rows and columns.\r\n\r\nIf a player placed a number to finish that row and if the total is equal to the sum, then the player is said to have met the QUOTA of that row/column. That player gains points equal to the QUOTA.\r\n\r\nPlay continues until either all rows and columns are finished or there are no moves remaining.\r\nEach player's scores are recorded.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Terminology:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Game:\r\n\r\nA game is one play of a random board, which proceeds as described above.\r\n\r\n## Set:\r\n\r\nA set consists of 2 games on the same board, where each player goes first once.  \r\nA set is won if one player earned more total points across both games than the other. If there is a tie in points, then the set is a tie. 3 points for a set win, 0 points for a set loss, and 1 point for a set tie.\r\n\r\n## Match:\r\n\r\nA match consists of 1 or more sets on different boards, where each player alternates first game-first move possession.  \r\nA match is won if one player has more match points than the other player and they have at least the number of match points required.\r\n\r\n### Recommended match point requirements:\r\n\r\n* Short: 3 points\r\n* Medium: 5 points\r\n* Long: 9 points\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nConcept: @technizor\r\nProgram: @technizor","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
