<hr>

<p>The game uses a 5x5 board, with 5 row and 5 column sums (QUOTAs) which are randomly generated.
Players take turns placing numbers from 1-3 onto the board.</p>

<p>If the total of the entries of a row/column are greater than or equal to the QUOTA, then that row/column is considered 'finished'. No moves can be made in finished rows and columns.</p>

<p>If a player placed a number to finish that row and if the total is equal to the sum, then the player is said to have met the QUOTA of that row/column. That player gains points equal to the QUOTA.</p>

<p>Play continues until either all rows and columns are finished or there are no moves remaining.
Each player's scores are recorded.</p>
