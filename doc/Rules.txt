QUOTA
Rules:
  The game uses a 5x5 board, with 5 row and 5 column sums (QUOTAs) which are randomly generated.
  Players take turns placing numbers from 1-3 onto the board.

  If the total of the entries of a row/column are greater than or equal to the QUOTA,
    then that row/column is considered 'finished'.
    and no more moves can be made in that row/column.

  If a player placed a number to finish that row
  and if the total is equal to the sum,
    Then the player is said to have met the QUOTA of that row/column.
    That player gains points equal to the QUOTA.

  Play continues until either all rows and columns are finished or there are no moves remaining.
  Each player's scores are recorded.

Terminology:
  Game: A game is one play of a random board, which proceeds as described above.
  Set: A set consists of 2 games on the same board, where each player goes first once.
    A set is won if one player earned more total points across both games than the other.
    If there is a tie in points, then the set is a tie.
    3 points for a set win, 0 points for a set loss, and 1 point for a set tie.
  Match: A match consists of 1 or more sets on different boards, where each player alternates
    first game-first move possession.
    A match is won if one player has more match points than the other player
    and they have at least the number of match points required.
    Recommended match point requirements:
      Short: 3 points
      Medium: 5 points
      Long: 9 points
