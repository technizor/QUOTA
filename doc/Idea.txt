5 by 5 grid of playing space
Each row and each column has a number assigned to it. (0-15)
Players take turns placing 1, 2, 3 in a space.
(You can theoretically automatically cross out any squares that are illegal no matter what is played or only allow legal moves)

Legal moves are moves that leave it possible to: create the exact sums of the corresponding row and column.

If a board has no moves left, then both players win points equal to the sum of the row/column sums they completed.

Matches are a 6 games in length, with first turn alternating between players.
If there is a tie after 6 games, then play a tiebreaker of 2 games.
Repeat if necessary.
